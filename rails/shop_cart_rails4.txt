Validation:

The Products controller accepts blank values. This is because there is no validation at Model.


Letâ€™s start by validating that the text fields all contain something before a row is written to the database

:~/Sites/depot/app/models$ cat product.rb 
#Output
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates   :title, :description, :image_url, presence: true
end

There is a flaw above. Price can be blank or invalid like 0.00. Adding one more validates statement.

validates   :price, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0.01} 


The title should be unique (primary DB key ?) 
validates   :title, uniqueness: true
